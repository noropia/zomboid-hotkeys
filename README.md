# Noropia Hotkeys

Configurable hotkeys for common actions in Project Zomboid. I'm a big proponent of quality-of-life mods, so moving tedious actions to a simple hotkey is pretty awesome. I hope it's useful for the Zomboid community!

## Features

See the [Mod Features](./docs/FEATURES.md) table for a more detailed summary of each feature, as well as a preview of upcoming features.

- **Open Notebook by Name**: Searches for a notebook by name, and opens it for reading/editing. Keep those shopping lists updated, without the hassle! Notebook name is configurable in mod options.

- **Place Item**: Places the highlighted inventory item into the world. This is a hotkey for the existing `Place Item` entry in the context menu. Happy decorating!

- **Open Walkman**: Searches the player's inventory for a music player (`Pocket player`, or carried `Boombox` from [True Music](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613146550) currently), and opens the menu.

- **Mark Trash**: Places the highlighted inventory into a garbage bag, removing it as a favorite (if applicable). Garbage bags named "Trash" are prioritized by default. Container name is configurable in mod options.

- **Mark Favorite**: Marks the highlighted inventory item as a favorite. Holy shit have I longed for this functionality.

- **Drop Item**: Drops the highlighted inventory item on the ground, regardless of the currently selected destination tab/container. Allows for quick sorting of wanted vs unwanted loot.

- **Apply Bandage**: Searches the player's inventory for a bandage (prioritized by type and sterilility), and applies it to the player's most serious unbandaged wound.
